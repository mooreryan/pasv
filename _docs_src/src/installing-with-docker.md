# Installing & Using PASV with Docker

*Note: If you're using Windows, I think this is your only option.  WSL may work, but I don't have a way to support it right now.*

*Note: if you use Docker, you won't have to install the [external dependencies](./installing-external-dependencies.md) that PASV relies on.  (Other than Docker of course!)*

The easiest way to get started with PASV is by using the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mooreryan/pasv) we have created.
