# Example: AOX/PTOX

There is a full example of using `pasv v1.3.0` to run the AOX/PTOX example from the [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.20.427478) on the [pasv v1 GitHub page](https://github.com/mooreryan/pasv_v1/blob/7e7f51f5c0914fc69ffcaa8e00472181c5bf9c6f/examples/aox_ptox/README.md).

The syntax of running `pasv` is different between versions 1 and 2, but the ideas from that example are the same.
